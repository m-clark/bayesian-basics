## Texts for Your Shelf


The following are three texts I recommend in my consulting to folks interested in doing Bayesian data analyis. They can be seen as introduction, intermediate, and advanced respectively.

Kruschke, J. (2014) *Doing Bayesian Data Analysis*. Very intro book, but might be good for those not too confident in statistics generally speaking. And who doesn't like puppies? Second edition has Stan examples.

McElreath, R. (2015). *Statistical Rethinking*.  A good modeling book in general, by one who has contributed a lot to helping others learn Stan.  Comes with its own R package too.

Gelman, A., Carlin, J. B., Stern, H. S., Dunson, D. B., Vehtari, A., and Rubin, D. B. (2013). *Bayesian Data Analysis*.
